        </div>
    </div> 
    <div class="back">Emily and Maggie have been inseparable since they first played together in day care as 5-year-olds. By fate, Emily and Maggie were neighbors across the street, and not only attended the same schools from Kindergarten to 12th grade, but also Chinese school on Saturdays. Often mistaken as sisters, Emily was the Yin to Maggie’s Yang as they complemented each other throughout the years. To this day, Emily will gladly continue to share the earbuds to her iPod Mini, do party quests together in Maplestory, go on foodie and boba adventures, binge-watch “Friends” for the 10th time, and someday rejoin the gym together with Maggie. Emily looks forward to experiencing many more important milestones in life with Maggie and to continue seeing Maggie’s beautiful and contagious smile.</div>

        </div>
    </div> 
    <div class="back">Tina and Maggie first met in the cafeteria during their first year of middle school. Being a freshman student struggling to make friends in a new environment, Tina is forever grateful for that first encounter with the dynamic duo, Emily and Maggie. From then on, it was after school adventures for Quickly’s milk tea and popcorn chicken everyday! Through the years, Maggie’s amusing sense of humor, cravings for good food, love for all things boba, and admirable work ethic has inspired Tina to always live her best life. </div>

        </div>
    </div> 
    <div class="back">Like many of the other bridesmaids, Susan and Maggie met during their middle school days over a decade ago. While sharing classes allowed them to become acquainted with one another, lunch time in the Roosevelt Middle School cafeteria was when their friendship started to develop. As they moved onto high school, they shared a love for the Korean pop band SHINee, both fangirling over the same favorite member. Susan can always count on Maggie for food adventures, pragmatic advice, and a smile to brighten up her day, from the start of their relationship 14 years ago to the future days of their everlasting friendship.</div>

        </div>
    </div> 
    <div class="back">Maggie was born two days before Susanna and met when they were both 13 years old at Roosevelt Middle School. Everyday after class, they would quickly finish their homework and sneak out to Clement Street for food and boba. Both 4.0 students, Susanna and Maggie got accepted into Lowell High School and continued to be best friends. Although they had no classes together, they would always spend time with each other during lunch breaks, on the weekends, and during holiday breaks. After high school, Susanna chose to study accounting at UCSB and Maggie went on to study nursing at USF. This was the first time they were 300 miles away, but stayed close updating each other about school, new friendships, and relationships. To this day, they are best friends and Susanna always goes to Maggie for advice, as she always has her life together. We love Maggie for her caring personality and will always love her as an older sister. </div>
